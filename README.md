Various dotfiles created/customized by Ivan Boothe. One branch for local terminal, one branch for hosted terminal (e.g. DigitalOcean console), each with setup instructions.

No guarantees to anyone that these work, are safe, will be maintained, etc.

See [the setup file](SETUP.md) for the good stuff.
